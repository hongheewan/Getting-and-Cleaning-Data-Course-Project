# CodeBook of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This codebook is to describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data sets.

Step 1:
  - Unzip the file 'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip' to the working directory.
  - variable 'activity' : Read the file of 'activity_labels.txt'
  - Variable 'feature' : Read the file of 'features.txt'.
  - Variable 'x_test' : Read the file of '/test/X_test.txt'.
  - Variable 'x_train' : Read the file of '/train/X_train.txt'.
  - Variable 'y_test' : Read the file of '/test/y_test.txt'.
  - Variable 'y_train' : Read the file of '/train/y_train.txt'.
  - Variable 'subject_test' : Read the file of '/test/subject_test.txt'.
  - Variable 'subject_train' : Read the file of /'train'subject_train.txt'.
  - Variable 'data_x': Merge the x_test and x_train by row with rbind().
  - Variable 'data_y' : Merge the y_test and y_train by row with rbind().
  - Variable 'data_subject' : Merge the subject_test and subject_train by row with rbind().
  - Variable 'data_ysub' : Merge the 'data_y' and 'data_subject' by column with cbind().
  - Variable 'data_all' : Merge the 'data_ysub' and 'data_x' by column with cbind() which results the merging of test and training data sets.

Step 2:
  - Variable 'featureName' : Select the feature with word 'mean' or 'std' in data set 'feature' with grep().
  - Variable 'data_meanstd':  Select the column subject, activity and columns which determine in step above from data set 'data_all'.

Step 3:
  - Change the characteristic of the activity field in data set 'data_meanstd' to factor with as.factor().
  - Assign the data set 'activity' to the levels of field 'activity' in data set 'data_meanstd'.

Step 4:
  - Rename the variable columns in data set 'data_meanstd' with more descriptive label by replacing the characters with gsub().   Characters to be replaced as below:
      * prefix t is replaced by time
      * prefix f is replaced by frequency
      * Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
      * Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
      * Mag is replaced by Magnitude
      * BodyBody is replaced by Body
